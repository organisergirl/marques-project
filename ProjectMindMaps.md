# Introduction #

Various aspects of the system under development, and the project overall, are documented as a series of mind maps. These mind maps have been generated using the [MindNode Pro](http://www.mindnode.com/) software.

Versions of each mind map are available in the native MindNode format as well as in [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) and [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) formats and are available via the [source code repository](AboutTheRepository.md).

Direct links to the PNG versions of the mind maps are outlined below.

## Development Phases ##

The [development-phases](http://marques-project.googlecode.com/git/assets/mind-maps/development-phases.png) mind map details the four phases of development for the system.
