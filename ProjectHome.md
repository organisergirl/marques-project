The MARQues project (Maps Answering Research Questions) is an [eResearch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eresearch) development project at [Flinders University](http://www.flinders.edu.au).

The goal of the project is the development a web based system that can be used to put datasets on a map with a focus on answering research questions. The system will be designed to be lightweight and reusable.
