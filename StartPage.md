# Introduction #

The MARQues (Maps Answering Research Questions) project is an [eResearch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eresearch) project at [Flinders University](http://www.flinders.edu.au/).

The goal of the project is the development a web based system that can be used to put datasets on a map with a focus on answering research questions. The system will be designed to be lightweight and reusable.

The core of the system is built around the [Lithium](http://lithify.me/) framework using the [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) scripting language.
