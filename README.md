# MARQues-project

These wiki files https://github.com/organisergirl/marques-project/tree/wiki are about the MARQues system that was custom built at Flinders University by Corey Wallis https://github.com/techxplorer to host the Australian Cinemas Map website http://auscinemas.flinders.edu.au/ and has been automatically exported from code.google.com/p/marques-project.

Any additional changes to the system will be documented here in the GitHub project wiki pages.
