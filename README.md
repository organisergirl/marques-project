# marques-project

The MARQues system was custom built at Flinders University by Corey Wallis (https://github.com/techxplorer) to host the Australian Cinemas Map website http://auscinemas.flinders.edu.au/ and has been automatically exported from http://code.google.com/p/marques-project.

Any additional changes to the system will be documented in the GitHub project wiki pages: https://github.com/organisergirl/marques-project/blob/wiki/README.md
