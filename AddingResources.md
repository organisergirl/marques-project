# Adding Resources to Cinema Records #

Digital, electronically available resources can be readily appended to cinema records via the MARQues system. As a site standard a link to CAARP (the Cinema Audiences in Australia Research Project) has been appended to every record in the system but additional, multiple resources can be easily added to individual Cinema records by using the process as outlined below.

# Method #

To append new electronic resource records to individual cinema records a few simple steps must be taken.

## Create the Resource Record ##
  1. Log in to MARQues and open the **Control Panel** (home) screen.
  1. Choose the option _Manage Resource Records_ from the list.
  1. Select the link at the top of the table to _Add New Record_.
  1. Input the _Title of the Resource_, a brief _Description of the Resource_ and paste the direct URL _Link to the Resource_ into the relevant boxes. (Note Resource Text Conventions below)
  1. Click on _Create New Record_.
  1. Take a note of the resulting **Resource ID** number.

Note in Example 4 above a link to one individual screening can also be made if preferred. Please also note Screening information must be added to CAARP in the first instance to generate the hyperlink for use in the AusCinemas record.

## Look up the Cinema Record ##
The unique number for the Cinema must be looked up before proceeding to link the Resource with the Cinema Record it relates to. To do this:

  1. From the MARQues **Control Panel** find the Cinema of interest via the _Search Cinema Records_ or _List All Cinema Records_.
  1. Take a note of the resulting **Record ID** number for the Cinema (as found at the top of the _Edit Cinema Record_ screen or in the ID column of the _List All Cinema Records_ table).

## Associate the Resource with the Cinema Record ##
  1. Start at the MARQues **Control Panel** screen.
  1. Choose the option _Manage Cinema and Resource Maps_ from the list.
  1. Select the _Add New Record_ link at the top of the table in the page.
  1. Input the _Unique Cinema ID_ (**Record ID**) and the _Unique Resources ID_ (**Resource ID**) (as previously noted).
  1. Click on _Create New Record_.

## Check Resource Addition ##
It is important to ensure that the process of creating and linking the Resource Record has been successful.

  1. Crosscheck the Resource addition by going to the Auscinemas website at http://auscinemas.flinders.edu.au/ and undertaking a search for a Cinema with one of the newly appended resources.
  1. Add the search results to the map and then click on the map marker to reveal the information window for the Cinema of interest.  The newly created Resource link should appear at the bottom of this window (under _Resources_) (along with the standard CAARP Resource link).
